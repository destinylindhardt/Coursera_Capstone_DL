This repository is dedicated to assignments completed in the Applied Data Science Capstone Course (9th and final course of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate). These assignments allowed me to practice retrieving and using location data from Foursquare about various areas and neighborhoods. I also learned how to parse HTML code in order to access data that was not readily available. Also, Folium was used to create maps to visualize the geospatial data.

In the files beginning with "Course 9 Week 3", BeautifulSoup was used to scrape information from a Wikipedia page containing postal codes, boroughs, and neighborhoods of Toronto. After reading in the latitudes and longitudes of the entries, I used Folium to generate a map of all boroughs containing the word "Toronto".

The other files in this repository are related to the final assignment. The goal was to use location data in order to logically determine the best place to open a restaurant. I figured it would be best to analyze suburban areas on the west side of Houston. In this repository, the files beginning with "Capstone" contain the code used to complete the project, a summarized PowerPoint presentation, and also a detailed report of the analysis.
